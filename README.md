 ###  A classic todo list app demonstrating proficiency with the DOM and local storage.
 
#### You can give it a go [here]( https://trevorton27.github.io/to-do-app2/)

## Instructions
1. Add your todo item in the input field.
2. Press enter or click the "Submit" button to add it to the list.
3. What's that you say? Finished with a task. Click on the tast to cross it off.
4. Want to remove the class from the list? Click the red button with the white "X".
5. Need to use the window for something else? Don't worry, your tasks will be saved in local storage. So you can come back to them later by simply reopening the app.
 
## Summary
This app was my first time working with the dom and using such functions as createElement(). I learned a lot about how JavaScript can plug in to HTML and also about the security issues of writing HTML directly in JavaScript.
